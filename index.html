  <h1>Welcome,</h1>
  <p>My name is Hugo Di Francesco, I make websites amongst other things and you can follow me here</p>
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>I'm a second year Mathematical Computation Student at UCL (read computer science and maths), and I've been making websites commercially for around a year now</p>
  <p>I like everything to do with programming, I like no-nonsense languages like C, and am quite proficient at front-end web technologies such as javascript, Sass/CSS and using frameworks (Bootstrap/Foundation to Express.js to Laravel 4 PHP).</p>
  <p>Automating things is the way to go for me, why would I have to update an entry when I can just give the end user the tools to do it himself? Well you always have to keep in mind that those kinds of abilities come at a price ie. breaking things but nonetheless, make it user-friendly and safe from an admin point of view and that's more free time to do things the end-user wouldn't be able to do</p>
  <p>This is also the reason why I love task runners like Grunt, it's sometimes a bit of a slog to set up but once it's done, well... You don't have to worry about running commands manually ~2 million times (for example compiling sass)</p>
  <p>More work, less code is the idea: use plugins but know that if you needed to you, you could write it yourself</p>
  <h2>Stack(s)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Styling Frameworks: ZURB Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap, using Sass</li>
    <li>Templating Language: Handlebars or Blade templates (whatever goes really as long as it looks like html)</li>
    <li>Backend Framework: Keystone.js (built on Express.js/Node.js and with Mongoose integration), Laravel 4 (I have also done procedural PHP)</li>
    <li>Database: SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) knowledge</li>
    <li>Integration: proficient jQuery user (AJAX, grabbing data from other fields and dynamic resizing)</li>
    <li>CSS3/HTML5 user but with backwards compatibility in mind</li>
    <li>User of plugins and libraries (especially for javascript): Underscore.js, async.js, velocity,js</li>
    <li>Fluent user of NPM, Bower and RubyGems</li>
    <li>Version-control with GitHub</li>
  </ul>
