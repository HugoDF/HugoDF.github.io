<p>I'm a second year Mathematical Computation Student at UCL (read computer science and maths), and I've been making websites commercially for around a year now</p>
<p>Front-end web technologies are my cup of tea. Anything from javascript to jQuery to responsive frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation), using Sass/CSS3, HTML5 features. All this frontend goodness is driven with Laravel 4 PHP or keystone.js/express.js/node.js, I'm also looking at my friend Markus Padourek's nice integration called <a href="http://sanestack.com/">SANE Stack</a> which takes Ember.js and Sails.js and integrates them together (convention over configuration and javascript full-stack) while also adding cool features like Docker integration and data storage solutions (PostGres, Redis, MongoDB). And possibly documenting that to help out any Ember.js newcomers looking for a full-stack solution.</p>
<p>Automating things is the way to go for me, anything from task runners (read Grunt.js) to heavily customising a CMS to reduce the work I have to do and also to fulfill user requirements.</p>
<p>More work, less code is the idea: use plugins but know that if you needed to you, you could write it yourself</p>
