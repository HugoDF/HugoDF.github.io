<p>So here's the scene: going home a bit early from the pub for a chilled night with the guys at home.</p>
<p>There's only this one thing stopping you... going to the supermarket and picking out one of those sterile shit beers to have.</p>
<p>The idea was: trivial choice => randomise it</p>
<p>So in came <a href="http://beerpicker.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Beer Picker</a> which was about 6 hour's work. Sinatra loading beers out of a YAML file one-pager deployed to heroku running on thin... That's it</p>
<p>I just like making things and they usually don't do too well but people like the concept so hopefully this time I can follow through a bit more</p>
