Alright so here it is, Hugo Di Francesco throwing himself into jekyll, ah the beauty of Ruby and Rails, never got round to doing some, skipped from PHP to PHP MVC to Express/Node.js,

All the while I'm actually just doing a LOT of frontend work, jQuery, CSS transitions, things that flash, responsive design, taming keystone.js,

Deployment to Heroku, running minification/uglification/compression tasks in Grunt, lovely stuff.

The most fun part of my day remains the fact that <span class='.k'>vh</span> and <span class='.k'>vw</span> (viewport height percentage and viewport width percentage) are not supported enough for client projects, which means reusing the standard javascript spaghetti-code approach, usually I already have jQuery loaded into my views (it is a requirement for both ZURB Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap) but I mean wouldn't it be nice if <code>height: 100%</code> actually did what it looks like it does? Love the quirks of all the languages, where would we be without errors everywhere, not at work that's for sure,

Most developers secretely love the pain that is debugging, decent IDEs do a decent job, an then there's always the option of just printing everything to figure out where we're going wrong.
