<p>I just scaled the heroku app to a hobby dyno :o,</p>
<p>This was a little play-around with ruby on rails, the twitter gem, I threw in a domain and twitter account and launched.</p>
<p>Next thing I know, I'm on Product Hunt (<a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/get-mad-ideas" target="_blank">link</a>), which is cool</p>
<p>Google analytics are saying I'm getting a ton of traffic, by my standards, on there, I went from around 600 votes to over a 1400</p>
<p>Good experience, hope the app ideas keep coming in and the voters keep voting</p>
<p>I'm guessing the next step will be to add some sort of better ranking algorithm, like HackerNews' one, or just have the ranking over a timescale.</p>
