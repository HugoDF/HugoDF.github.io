My page is finally up to date with everything, all the sections are nicely separated and appear in the topbar, the content has a minimum height, the colours are changed, my name is repeated less often in the footer for example.

Liquid templating is the usual: different templating language -> a bit of time to work out how to do what you want, otherwise all is good (it actually took me around 10 minutes to figure out what templating language was used, of course). Also played around with the YAML file, same again took me the best part of a minute and a half to figure out how to have an array of email addresses.
