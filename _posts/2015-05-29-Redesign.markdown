You see this website now but it's literally gone from darkness to light, the original theme was based around a dark grey background with white text and electric green links. Now it's about clouds, standard white on black with red links.

In terms of design it's functional and uses standard design components.

I had too much content so I simplified it into bulletpoints, and made it more of a grid/tile display.

The image with massive border-radius (ie corners so rounded the images looks circular) is a regular fixture of social media and blogging websites of today.

I'm quite proud of the background image which I took myself, the pages don't scroll much so it's not used to its full potential.

The responsive navbar came courtesy of jekyll as did the footer.
