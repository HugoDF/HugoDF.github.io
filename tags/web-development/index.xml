      <description>A look at the shifting boundaries of the web development stack
This was originally posted as an answer on Quora: How do frontend code and backend code interact with each other?
Let’s start with quick definitions:
Frontend All things the browser can read, display and/or run. This means HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tells the browser “what” content is, eg. “heading”, “paragraph”, “list”, “list item”.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) tells the browser how to display elements eg.</description>

      <description>When should you use JavaScript when you can use CSS? This post was sparked by a question I answered on Quora: Which is better to use, CSS or JS?
The web frontend is built with the triumvirate of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (see “Backend code, frontend code and how they interact” for more details): HTML says what things are, CSS how they look and JavaScript does all the things the other two can’t.</description>

      <description>Things we’re not used to tend to be harder
I’m a developer, and I CSS. I probably have written more CSS than I have written Java, Ruby, PHP, Python and JavaScript combined.
Being a front-end developer is a dying art. By front-end I don’t mean ES6, Babelifyied React SPAs. I mean meat and potatoes: “here’s a design, turn it into a website please”.
CSS doesn’t get the love it deserves in the developer crowd.</description>
