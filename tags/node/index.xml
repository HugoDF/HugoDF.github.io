      <description>There always comes a point in a web application&amp;rsquo;s life where an operation is best served in the background, this is where queues come in.
There are a few queuing solutions in Node. None of them are ridiculously dominant, eg. Kue, RSMQ, Bee Queue, bull. The issue with Kue, RSMQ and Bee Queue was its use of a done callback as the recommended API.
Bull https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull is a premium Queue package for handling jobs and messages in NodeJS.</description>

      <description>When using docker-compose, it‚Äôs good practice to make anything that relies on Postgres wait for it to be up before launching. This avoids connection issues inside the app.
This post walks through how to deliver this functionality both as a CLI and a module that works both as a CommonJS module (require) and ES modules, without transpilation.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are situations where &lt;code&gt;Date.now&lt;/code&gt; is used in application code. That code needs to be tested, and it‚Äôs always a struggle to remember how to mock &lt;code&gt;Date.now&lt;/code&gt;. Here is the magic snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Testing is a crucial part of the software development process. It helps to catch bugs, avoid regressions and to document the behaviour of a piece of software.
Express is one of the most widespread libraries for building backend applications in JavaScript. What follows is a summary of how to set up an efficient unit testing strategy for such an application as well as a couple of situations you may be faced with when attempting to test.</description>

Command line apps are a neat way to package repetitive tasks. This will walk you through some tools that are useful to build CLI apps.

      <title>Setting up Express and Redis with Docker compose</title>

      <description>Redis and Express are tools that provide a simple and clean approach to their problem domains.
The repo is available at: https://github.com/HugoDF/express-redis-docker.
Redis is ‚Äúan open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker‚Äù. It‚Äôs as simple and unopinionated as a database as it gets, it‚Äôs known for its performance and simplicity as a key-value store. It has great flexibility and can also be used as a message queue, circular buffer (and pretty much anything else a developer can come up with short of a relational database).</description>

      <description>The ES2015 or ES6 specification introduced class to JavaScript. Libraries like React went from React.createClass to class MyComponent extends React.Component, ie went from rolling their own constructor to leveraging a language built-in to convey the programmer‚Äôs intent.
For a Node.js web application‚Äôs persistence layer, a few databases come to mind like MongoDB (possibly paired with mongoose), or a key-value store like Redis.
