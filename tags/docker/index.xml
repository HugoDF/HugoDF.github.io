      <description>Redis and Express are tools that provide a simple and clean approach to their problem domains.
The repo is available at: https://github.com/HugoDF/express-redis-docker.
Redis is “an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker”. It’s as simple and unopinionated as a database as it gets, it’s known for its performance and simplicity as a key-value store. It has great flexibility and can also be used as a message queue, circular buffer (and pretty much anything else a developer can come up with short of a relational database).</description>
