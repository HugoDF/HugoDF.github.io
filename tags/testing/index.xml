      <description>A JavaScript testing library for 2017
AVA is a Futuristic JavaScript test runner.
Some of its best features are:
 it works out of the box, no need to specify a blob for test files or add Babel hooks
 it’s runs tests in parallel, this stops you from using global state and runs faster
 the tests are async by default
  I quite like AVA since I can just drop it in and reap benefits without too much hassle.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are situations where &lt;code&gt;Date.now&lt;/code&gt; is used in application code. That code needs to be tested, and it’s always a struggle to remember how to mock &lt;code&gt;Date.now&lt;/code&gt;. Here is the magic snippet:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Testing is a crucial part of the software development process. It helps to catch bugs, avoid regressions and to document the behaviour of a piece of software.
Express is one of the most widespread libraries for building backend applications in JavaScript. What follows is a summary of how to set up an efficient unit testing strategy for such an application as well as a couple of situations you may be faced with when attempting to test.</description>

      <title>From AngularJS to Vue.js, CommonJS and Jest</title>

      <description>The trials and tribulations of kicking off an AngularJS -&amp;gt; Vue.js migration
 AngularJS was pretty groundbreaking. It’s still impressive to this day, packed with a router, an HTTP client, a dependency injection system and a bunch of other things I haven’t necessarily had the pleasure of dealing with. It also wraps most browser APIs as injectable services, that’s pretty cool. The downside is that it’s complicated: services, filters, injectors, directives, controllers, apps, components.</description>
