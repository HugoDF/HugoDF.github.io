      <description>A look at the shifting boundaries of the web development stack
This was originally posted as an answer on Quora: How do frontend code and backend code interact with each other?
Let’s start with quick definitions:
Frontend All things the browser can read, display and/or run. This means HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) tells the browser “what” content is, eg. “heading”, “paragraph”, “list”, “list item”.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) tells the browser how to display elements eg.</description>

      <description>Functions: the killer JavaScript feature we never talk about.
JavaScript is a very in-demand language today. It runs in a lot of places from the browser to embedded systems and it brings a non-blocking I/O model that is faster than others for some types of applications. What really sets JavaScript apart from the rest of scripting languages is its highly functional nature.
 JavaScript has more in common with functional languages like Lisp or Scheme than with C or Java.</description>

      <title>10 minute JavaScript: Library development in ES6 with Babel, Mocha and npm scripts</title>

      <description>JavaScript has a thriving ecosystem of libraries delivered as packages on npm. Node has a high degree of compatibility with ES6 but it doesn’t have some features yet, namely import. This means that if we want to distribute useable packages over npm and we want to be writing ES6, we have to transpile back to ES5.
We’ll be setting up a project that allows us to write ES6, and distribute it in ES5 (with Babel) and to test it with Mocha, all through npm scripts.</description>

      <title>Recursion in JavaScript with ES6, destructuring and rest/spread</title>

      <description>The latest ECMA standard for JavaScript (ECMAScript 6) makes JavaScript more readable by encouraging a more declarative style with functional constructs and new operators.
Destructuring One of my favourite ES6 features is destructuring. It allows you to extract data from one variable to another by using structure. For arrays this means for example:
var [first, second] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // first: 1 // second: 2  There’s more you can do, like skip some members of the array on the right-hand side of the operation.</description>

      <description>When should you use JavaScript when you can use CSS? This post was sparked by a question I answered on Quora: Which is better to use, CSS or JS?
The web frontend is built with the triumvirate of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (see “Backend code, frontend code and how they interact” for more details): HTML says what things are, CSS how they look and JavaScript does all the things the other two can’t.</description>

      <description>A JavaScript testing library for 2017
AVA is a Futuristic JavaScript test runner.
Some of its best features are:
 it works out of the box, no need to specify a blob for test files or add Babel hooks
 it’s runs tests in parallel, this stops you from using global state and runs faster
 the tests are async by default
  I quite like AVA since I can just drop it in and reap benefits without too much hassle.</description>

      <description>Spices and other ingredients of a great curry
To use JavaScript to its full potential you have to embrace its strong functional programming base. We’re going to explore some crucial and powerful functional constructs: closures, partial application and currying that make JavaScript terse yet understandable.
The basics Functional programming is a programming paradigm that follows a more mathematical computation model. Let’s go through some basics to make your JavaScript more functional.</description>

      <title>Why CSS is hard</title>

      <description>Things we’re not used to tend to be harder
I’m a developer, and I CSS. I probably have written more CSS than I have written Java, Ruby, PHP, Python and JavaScript combined.
Being a front-end developer is a dying art. By front-end I don’t mean ES6, Babelifyied React SPAs. I mean meat and potatoes: “here’s a design, turn it into a website please”.
CSS doesn’t get the love it deserves in the developer crowd.</description>

      <title>Setting up Express and Redis with Docker compose</title>
      <link>https://codewithhugo.com/setting-up-express-and-redis-with-docker-compose/</link>

      <guid>https://codewithhugo.com/setting-up-express-and-redis-with-docker-compose/</guid>
      <description>Redis and Express are tools that provide a simple and clean approach to their problem domains.
The repo is available at: https://github.com/HugoDF/express-redis-docker.
Redis is “an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker”. It’s as simple and unopinionated as a database as it gets, it’s known for its performance and simplicity as a key-value store. It has great flexibility and can also be used as a message queue, circular buffer (and pretty much anything else a developer can come up with short of a relational database).</description>

      <title>From AngularJS to Vue.js, CommonJS and Jest</title>

      <description>The trials and tribulations of kicking off an AngularJS -&amp;gt; Vue.js migration
 AngularJS was pretty groundbreaking. It’s still impressive to this day, packed with a router, an HTTP client, a dependency injection system and a bunch of other things I haven’t necessarily had the pleasure of dealing with. It also wraps most browser APIs as injectable services, that’s pretty cool. The downside is that it’s complicated: services, filters, injectors, directives, controllers, apps, components.</description>

      <title>Split an existing git commit</title>

      <description>One of git&amp;rsquo;s main differences when compared to other version control systems is that it lets the user rewrite the history. The main way to do this is to use git rebase, usually followed by a git push --force to overwrite history the remote with the local history.
Here’s a look at how to split existing commits using rebase, reset and commit.
Say you have two files edited in a commit (A and B) and you would like to get the changes from one of those files (A) into your current branch but not those from the other (B).</description>

      <description>Vue.js is &amp;ldquo;The Progressive JavaScript Framework&amp;rdquo;. It takes inspiration from all prior art in the view library and frontend framework world, including AngularJS, React, Angular, Ember, Knockout and Polymer. In Vue (and Angular/AngularJS), a directive is a way to wrap functionality that usually applies to DOM elements. The example in Vue&amp;rsquo;s documentation is a focus directive.
When running Vue.js inside of AngularJS, an issue occured whereby the AngularJS router would try to resolve normal anchors&amp;rsquo; href on click.</description>

      <title>Using ES6 classes for Sequelize 4 models</title>

      <description>The ES2015 or ES6 specification introduced class to JavaScript. Libraries like React went from React.createClass to class MyComponent extends React.Component, ie went from rolling their own constructor to leveraging a language built-in to convey the programmer’s intent.
For a Node.js web application’s persistence layer, a few databases come to mind like MongoDB (possibly paired with mongoose), or a key-value store like Redis.
To run a relational database with a Node application, Sequelize, “An easy-to-use multi SQL dialect ORM for Node.</description>

      <title>Writing an npm module with TypeScript and microbundle</title>

      <guid>https://codewithhugo.com/writing-an-npm-module-with-typescript-and-microbundle/</guid>
      <description>For those looking to write a package and publish it to npm, TypeScript + microbundle is a low-friction way to build a high-quality library.
Why TypeScript? TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that adds static types to it. Its other features also follow the ECMAScript specification (current and future) quite closely. For library authors this means you provide the consumers of your library, even those who don’t use TypeScript with more details around expected types and for some editors/IDEs that integrate with TypeScript (like Visual Studio Code) nicer auto-complete.</description>

      <description>React vs Angular vs Vue: Why it doesn’t matter.
2018 marks the end of JavaScript fatigue and the “framework wars” A typical frontend/JavaScript developer career usually involves some jQuery and associated plugins before moving on to React, Angular or Vue.
Having experienced React, Vue and Angular, it seems they solve similar problems in a similar way. Where they differ is the setup experience and best-practices. In more ways than one, the mental model of these frameworks/libraries have converged to the component model.</description>

      <description>The tools we wield define us, git is the one tool all developers use Git is a ubiquitous version control tool. The way it works tightly correlates with software engineering and the mindsets of developers. It was purpose-built and designed to be used for the development of the Linux Kernel, one of the largest software projects that’s depended on by millions of developers.
Your editing workflow is painful because it’s not version-controlled As part of a team, your editing workflow probably consists of sending a file back and forth for review, comment and amendments.</description>
